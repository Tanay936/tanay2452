Hello, My name is Tanay Ollalwar and this is my final exam for computer science.
<br>

In the past 12 weeks I learned how to install tools like GitHub, the platform that is linked to your code editor, Visual Studio code. To code other tools like homebrew, GitHub portals, jupyter noebooks, python packages,etc. Using these tools I learned how to use GitHub and Visual studio code. I learned how to make blogs, and how to edit them. During this time there were a lot of issuses like hoe do I get my blog on a locohost? or How do I add picture and color to my blog? I were able to solve these with the help of my TA's Tanisha and Rachit, but I also recived a lot of help from my peers.Also during this 12 weeks we thaught and learned lessons from our peers. Me, Aarav, Zhengji, and Advait thaugt arrays. It was hard planing and finding information on how to teach arrays. When we thaught we were nervous but as we thaught we found it fun to teach and help others understand the lessons. We also found out that teaching something helps you to uderstand the topics better. During teaching arrays we had to work on a shared repository. We had to communicate a lot, when to make chaches, ehn to not, when to git pull, etc. This experiace was hard at first but it got easier as we undersootd each other. This was even easier as we worked on the RPG game. As we fined our lesson we had to send a pull request to Mr. Mortenson, which was harder than we thought.
