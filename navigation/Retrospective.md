Hello, My name is Tanay Ollalwar and this is my final exam for computer science.
<br>

Over the past 12 weeks, I have learned how to install and use various tools such as GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Homebrew, GitHub Portals, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python packages, which helped me develop and edit blogs. Along the way, I faced challenges like deploying my blog on a localhost and adding images and colors, but with the support of my TA’s, Tanisha and Rachit, as well as my peers, I was able to troubleshoot and resolve these issues. A key part of this journey was peer-led lessons, where I, along with Aarav, Zhengji, and Advait, taught a lesson on arrays. Planning and researching how to present the topic was difficult, and though we were initially nervous, we found it enjoyable and realized that teaching deepens one’s own understanding. While working on this lesson, we collaborated in a shared repository, which required effective communication about making changes, avoiding conflicts, and properly using git pull. At first, this was challenging, but as we understood each other’s workflow, it became easier, especially when working on our RPG game. Finally, after completing our lesson, we submitted a pull request to Mr. Mortenson, which turned out to be more complex than expected but was a valuable experience in version control and collaboration.
